# What comments are NOT made for is:
- writing explanatory notes to self (e.g. Will finish this later).
- Blaming stuff on other people (e.g., John coded this, Ask him.).
- Writing vauge statement (e.g., This is another math function).
- erasing chucks of code. 

# Examples of good comment use are:
- Authoring specifications (e.g., Coded by John, November 13th 2010).
- Detailed statements on the functionality of a method or procedure (e.g., This function validates the login form with the aid of the e-mail check function).
- Quick notifications or labels that state where a recent change was made (Added e-mail validation procedure.).

# We need the comments to tell us why it works

# You should always write your code as if comments didn't exist.

# Code can tell you how the program works

# Comments can tell you why it works.
